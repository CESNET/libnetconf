Prerequisites
=============

You will need to have installed the following software. Header
files (-dev or -devel packages) of the following libraries are
also needed to compile libnetconf.

- libxml2
  http://xmlsoft.org

- libssh2
  Version 1.2.9 or greater is recomended.
  http://www.libssh2.org

  To disable usage of the libssh2, use:

  $ ./configure --disable-libssh2

  In such a case, libnetconf will use standalone ssh(1) client
  application to connect NETCONF client to the NETCONF server.
  ssh(1) is available as a part of the OpenSSH.

- DBus
  libdbus version 1.0.0 or greater
  http://dbus.freedesktop.org

  DBus is required by the NETCONF Notifications subsystem. If the
  Notifications support is switched off, DBus is no more needed:

  $ ./configure --disable-notifications


The remaining items are optional.

- doxygen
  Used to generate documentation from the source code.
  Version 1.8.0 or greater is recommended.
  http://www.doxygen.org

- rpmbuild
  Used to build RPM package.
  http://www.rpm.org


Building / Installation
=======================

To install libnetconf with default options:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

This way the library will be installed in /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/include respectively. Configure can have many
options specified, to show them all use:

$ ./configure --help
