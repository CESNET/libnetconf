/**
 * @ingroup notifications_xml
 * @brief Store a new event into the specified stream. Parameters are specific
 * for different events.
 *
 * ### Event parameters:
 * - #NCNTF_GENERIC
 *  - **const xmlNodePtr content** Content of the notification as defined in RFC 5277.
 *  eventTime is added automatically. The parameter can be a single XML node as
 *  well as a node list.
 * - #NCNTF_BASE_CFG_CHANGE
 *  - #NC_DATASTORE **datastore** Specify which datastore has changed.
 *  - #NCNTF_EVENT_BY **changed_by** Specify the source of the change.
 *   - If the value is set to #NCNTF_EVENT_BY_USER, the following parameter is
 *   required:
 *  - **const struct nc_session* session** Session that required the configuration change.
 * - #NCNTF_BASE_CPBLT_CHANGE
 *  - **const struct nc_cpblts* old** Old list of capabilities.
 *  - **const struct nc_cpblts* new** New list of capabilities.
 *  - #NCNTF_EVENT_BY **changed_by** Specify the source of the change.
 *   - If the value is set to #NCNTF_EVENT_BY_USER, the following parameter is
 *   required:
 *  - **const struct nc_session* session** Session that required the configuration change.
 * - #NCNTF_BASE_SESSION_START
 *  - **const struct nc_session* session** Started session (#NC_SESSION_STATUS_DUMMY session is also allowed).
 * - #NCNTF_BASE_SESSION_END
 *  - **const struct nc_session* session** Finished session (#NC_SESSION_STATUS_DUMMY session is also allowed).
 *  - #NC_SESSION_TERM_REASON **reason** Session termination reason.
 *   - If the value is set to #NC_SESSION_TERM_KILLED, the following parameter is
 *   required.
 *  - **const char* killed-by-sid** The ID of the session that directly caused
 *  the session termination. If the session was terminated by a non-NETCONF
 *  process unknown to the server, use NULL as the value.
 *
 * ### Examples:
 * - ncxmlntf_event_new("mystream", -1, NCNTF_GENERIC, my_xml_data);
 * - ncxmlntf_event_new("netconf", -1, NCNTF_BASE_CFG_CHANGE, NC_DATASTORE_RUNNING, NCNTF_EVENT_BY_USER, my_session);
 * - ncxmlntf_event_new("netconf", -1, NCNTF_BASE_CPBLT_CHANGE, old_cpblts, new_cpblts, NCNTF_EVENT_BY_SERVER);
 * - ncxmlntf_event_new("netconf", -1, NCNTF_BASE_SESSION_START, my_session);
 * - ncxmlntf_event_new("netconf", -1, NCNTF_BASE_SESSION_END, my_session, NC_SESSION_TERM_KILLED, "123456");
 *
 * @param[in] etime Time of the event, if set to -1, the current time is used.
 * @param[in] event Event type to distinguish the following parameters.
 * @param[in] ... Specific parameters for different event types as described
 * above.
 * @return 0 for success, non-zero value else.
