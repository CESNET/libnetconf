/**
 * \page datastores Datastores Usage
 *
 * NETCONF defines usage of three datastores: running (mandatory),
 * startup (optional via :startup capability) and candidate (optional via
 * :candidate capability). libnetconf provides all these datastores.
 *
 * In addition to the described NETCONF point of view, libnetconf divides all
 * datastores (running, startup and candidate) into datastore parts connected
 * with a specific (basic) configuration data model. Each datastore part is
 * created by ncds_new() or ncds_new_transapi() function. According to the
 * specified datastore type, server should set up additional datastore settings
 * (see section \ref ds_settings). If some specific validation settings are needed,
 * ncds_set_validation() function can be used (more information about validation
 * can be found at a separated \ref validation "page". Finnaly, to activate
 * datastore and to get its unique identifier, ncds_init() function must be
 * called.
 *
 * If you want to use some data model that extends (by import or augment
 * statement) any of the used data models, functions ncds_add_model() or
 * ncds_add_models_path() can be used to specify location of the extension data
 * model(s).
 *
 * By default, all features defined in configuration data models are disabled.
 * To enable specific features or all features at once, you can use
 * ncds_feature_enable() and ncds_features_enableall() functions.
 *
 * To finish changes made to the datastores (adding augment data models,
 * enabling and disabling features, etc.), server must call ncds_consolidate()
 * function.
 *
 * As a next step, device controlled by the server should be initialized. This
 * should includes copying startup configuration data into the running
 * datastore (and applying them to the current device settings).
 *
 * \anchor ds_settings
 * ## Datastore Settings ##
 *
 * - Empty Datastore (*NCDS_TYPE_EMPTY*)
 *
 *   There is no additional settings for this datastore type.
 *
 * - \ref fileds (*NCDS_TYPE_FILE*)
 *
 *   ncds_file_set_path() to set file to store datastore content.
 *
 * - \ref customds (*NCDS_TYPE_CUSTOM*)
 *
 *   This type of datastore implementation is provided by the server, not by
 *   libnetconf.
 *
 *   ncds_custom_set_data() sets server specific functions implementing the
 *   datastore. In this case, server is required to implement functions
 *   from #ncds_custom_funcs structure.
 *

/**
 * \page validation Data Validation
 *
 * [RFC6241]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241 "RFC 6241"
 *
 * [RFC 6241][RFC6241] defines NETCONF :validate capability intended to allow
 * validation of the configuration data. This capability specifies new operation
 * \<validate\> and adds \<test-option\> parameter to the \<edit-config\>
 * operation.
 *
 * On the client side, libnetconf allows to create \<validate\> RPC as well as
 * to specify \<test-option\> of \<edit-config\> RPC.
 *
 * On the server side, libnetconf performs data validation on \ref datastores
 * "datastore parts" that provides validators. libnetconf use Relax NG schema
 * to validate syntax of the datastore content and Schematron to check semantics.
 * Validators are loaded as a standalone files generated by *lnctool(1)*, which
 * is part of libnetconf standard instalation.
 *
 * libnetconf automatically searches for the validators during ncds_new() and
 * ncds_new_transapi() calls. Validators are supposed to be placed in the same
 * directory as data model provided to the mentioned function as its model_path
 * parameter. Alternatively, validators can be connected with the datastore
 * manually, using ncds_set_validation(). This function also allows to switch
 * off validation on a specific datastore part.
 *
 * ## lnctool(1) Usage ##
 *
 * Complete list of *lnctool(1)*'s options can be displayed using -h option:
 *
 *     $ lnctool -h
 *
 * Based on a YANG data model, *lnctool(1)* generates all necessary files needed
 * by libnetconf. Basically, it generates YIN format of the data model required
 * by ncds_new() and ncds_new_transapi() functions. If you use some extension
 * models via ncds_add_model() or ncds_add_models_path(), you have to specify
 * also these models as *lnctool(1)*'s \<augment models\> parameter.
 *
 * When used with -v option, *lnctool(1)* additionally generates Relax NG
 * schemas and Schematron XSL stylesheet for validation. Here is an example
 * for NACM data model (directory ./models/ contains *ietf-netconf-acm.yang*
 * and *ietf-yang-types.yang* models):
 *
 *     $ lnctool -v -o ./nacm -p ../models/ ./models/ietf-netconf-acm.yang
 *     ### Converting YANG to YIN
 *              creating ./nacm/ietf-netconf-acm.yin
 *              creating ./nacm/ietf-yang-types.yin
 *     ### Done
 *     ### Generating Relax NG schemas for validation
 *              creating ./nacm/ietf-netconf-acm-data.rng
 *              creating ./nacm/ietf-netconf-acm-gdefs.rng
 *     ### Done
 *     ### Generating Schematron Stylesheet
 *              creating ./nacm/ietf-netconf-acm-schematron.xsl
 *     ### Done
 *
 * Path to the output directory should be specified in the server source code
 * to allow libnetconf to find imported data model (*ietf-yang-types.yin* in
 * this case).
 *
 * \note Return value checks are skipped in this example for simplicity. Do not
 * copy-paste this example. Also note, that NACM is one of internal libnetconf
 * datastores and it is not needed to add it manually by ncds_new(). This is
 * JUST a simple (stupid) example.
 *
 * <p></p>
 *
 *     ds = ncds_new(NCDS_TYPE_FILE, "./nacm/ietf-netconf-acm.yin", NULL);
 *     ncds_file_set_path(ds, ds_path);
 *     ncds_init(ds);
 *     ncds_add_models_path("./models/");
 *     ncds_consolidate();
 *
 * If the validators files are stored in the same directory as
 * a basic data model (*ietf-netconf-acm.yin* in this case), libnetconf
 * automatically loads them during ncds_new() or ncds_new_transapi() calls. If
 * you store the validators files somewhere else, ncds_set_validation() function
 * can be used to specify their location:
 *
 *     ncds_set_validation(ds, 1, "./nacm/ietf-netconf-acm-data.rng", "./nacm/ietf-netconf-acm-schematron.xsl");
 *
 * If validators files are not found or validation is switched off (via
 * ncds_set_validation() with enable parameter set to 0), validation is not
 * performed on such datastore part.
