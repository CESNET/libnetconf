.SH NAME
nacm \- NETCONF Access Control Module (NACM) 
NACM is a transparent subsystem of libnetconf\&. It is activated using \fBNC_INIT_NACM\fP flag in the \fBnc_init()\fP function\&. No other action is required to use NACM in libnetconf\&. All NACM rules and settings are controlled via standard NETCONF operations since NACM subsystem provides implicit datastore accessible with the \fBncds_apply_rpc2all()\fP function\&.
.PP
libnetconf supports usage of the system groups (/etc/group) in the access control rule-lists\&. To disable this feature, <enable-external-groups> value must be set to false:
.PP
.PP
.nf
<nacm xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-acm">
  <enable-external-groups>false</enable-external-groups>
</nacm>

.SH "Recovery Session"
.PP
Recovery session serves for setting up initial access rules or to repair a broken access control configuration\&. If a session is recognized as recovery, NACM subsystem is completely bypassed\&.
.PP
By default, libnetconf considers all sessions of the user with the system UID equal zero as recovery\&. To change this default value to a UID of any user, use configure's \fB--with-nacm-recovery-uid\fP option\&.
.SS "Initial operation"
According to \fCRFC 6536\fP, libnetconf's NACM subsystem is initially set to allow reading (permitted read-default), refuse writing (denied write-default) and allow operation execution (permitted exec-default)\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Some operations or data have their specific access control settings defined in their data models\&. These settings override the described default settings\&.
.RE
.PP
To change this initial settings, user has to access NACM datastore via a recovery session (since any write operation is denied) and set required access control rules\&.
.PP
For example, to change default write rule from deny to permit, use edit-config operation to create (merge) the following configuration data:
.PP
.PP
.nf
<nacm xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-acm">
  <write-default>permit</write-default>
</nacm>
.fi
.PP
.PP
To guarantee all access rights to a specific users group, use edit-config operation to create (merge) the following rule:
.PP
.PP
.nf
<nacm xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-acm">
  <rule-list>
    <name>admin-acl</name>
    <group>admin</group>
    <rule>
      <name>permit-all</name>
      <module-name>*</module-name>
      <access-operations>*</access-operations>
      <action>permit</action>
    </rule>
  </rule-list>
</nacm>
